            what to do: <br>
            1. You can add matches by clicking on the green "Add" button. Use the arrows next to it to change the number of matches you want to add. <br>
            2. To move the matches, boxes or stacks around you can click and hold on them and they will move with you. <br>
            3. To select matches, boxes or stacks just click on them and they will highlight. If you do not want to select them anymore just 
            click again and they will go back to normal<br>
            4. You can use the arrows near the 'group of' to change the group size. Sometimes, these arrows cannot be used - a message will appear saying why. <br>
            5. To use the Group and Ungroup button you must select some of the sticks or boxes.
            To successfully "Group" some sticks, you must select the correct number of sticks.
            The "Ungroup" button splits the selected things into multiple smaller ones if it can.
