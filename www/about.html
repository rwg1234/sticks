            The application on this webpage is intended to be used to help to teach children understand the notion of "the base" - 
            grouping elements with different bases (base 2, base 10, ...).
            It has been developed for the School of Education of the University of Glasgow as a part of a Team Project for the Computing Science 
            course at the University of Glasgow.
