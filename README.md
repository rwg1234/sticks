# Try it Yourself

A Web app for School of Education of Glasgow to help children count.

## Compatibility

Works with Google Chrome/Mozilla Firefox/Microsoft Edge.

But may not work with Samsung's browser, or with Mac OS Safari (although it does appear to work on iOS Safari).

## Deployment

To deploy, simply make the contents of the /www/ directory availible on any static web server.
Note that the javascript will not work if you run it without a server, you need a server for phaser.js.
If you want to test it without deploying anywhere, you can use `python -m http.server` or something similar.
